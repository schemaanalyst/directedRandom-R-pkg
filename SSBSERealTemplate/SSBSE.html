    <h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Analyse Wilcox Rank and Effect Size for AVM and Directed Random</h3>
    <p>To statistically analyze the the new technique we conducted tests for significance with the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test, using the sets of 30 execution times obtained with a specific DBMS and all techniques <strong>Hitchhicker Guide Ref</strong>. A p-value that less than <span class="math inline">\(0.05\)</span> is considered significant. To review practical are significance tests we use the nonparametric A12 statistic of Vargha and Delaney <strong>REF</strong> was used to calculate effect sizes. The A12 determine the average probability that one approach beats another, or how superior one technique compared to the other. We followed the guidelines of Vargha and Delaney in that an effect size is considered to be “large” if the value of A12 is $ &lt; 0:29$ or <span class="math inline">\(&gt; 0.71\)</span>, “medium” if A12 is <span class="math inline">\(&lt; 0.36\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(&gt; 0.64\)</span> and “small” if A12 is <span class="math inline">\(&lt; 0.44\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(&gt; 0.56\)</span>. However, is the values of A12 close to the 0.5 value are viewed as there no effect.</p>
    <p>When comparing AVM and Directed Random techniques in regard of time we used Mann-Whitney U-test and the A-hat effect size calculations. As Shown in in the following two tables that there is statistically significat differance between Driected Random and AVM, <span class="math inline">\(p \leq 0.05\)</span>. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between AVM and Directed Random. As p-value near zero, that directed random is faster than AVM in a statistically significant test. Moreover, the A-12 shows that Directed Random has a large effect size when it comes to test generation timing. Which menas that Directed Random is the winner in regard of test generation timing.</p>
